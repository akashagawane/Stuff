find dir1 dir2 dir3 dir4 -type d -exec cp header.html {} \; =>
  a. First, I use the Linux find command, and I tell it to look in four sub-directories (dir1, dir2, dir3 and dir4).
  b. I tell it to find only directories (-type d).
  c. I then issue the Linux copy (cp) command, and copy the file header.html to each directory that is found, one directory at a time

for f in `find . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d`; do
  cd "$f"
  <your job here>
  Done
Explanation : find . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d : Only find directories with a maximum recursive depth of 1
(only the subdirectories of $1) and minimum depth of 1 (excludes current folder .)

SIMULATOR:
  http://vlsi.pro/verilog-timescales/ -> Time Scale
  `timescale 1ns/1ps means , Whatever times you mentioned in verilog code will be taken in ns.
  eg. #22; //22 ns
  Resolution of 1ps means you can have
  #0.001; // 0.001 ns / 1ps as smallest representation of the time.
  #0.000123; // this means 0 ns
  Like we have to collect Rs100 and the smallest value of RS should be Rs 1.So if you give 50 paise you will noy count it in RS 100. 1ns/1ps is similar to 100/1
